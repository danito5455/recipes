    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These 5-Ingredient Brownies are made using only super basic pantry staples! 
        All you need is flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and cocoa powder, 
        and less than 1 hour of time from start-to-finish. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li>2 sticks melted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Optional - a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt! </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Make the Brownies</h4>
            <li>oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9x9 baking dish with parchment paper. 
            </li>
            <li>Stir together the melted butter and sugar</li>
            <li>Stir in the eggs, 2 at a time. Add the flour and cocoa powder, 
                and stir until you have a smooth chocolate batter! 
                (Add the vanilla and salt here, if using, and stir.)</li>

            <h4>Bake</h4>
            <li>Pour the batter into your baking dish and bake for 35-40 minutes. 
                The top will look set, and a toothpick inserted will have moist crumbs 
                on it, but it shouldn't have runny batter. 
                (You can also use the tip of a knife to lift up a 
                little piece from the center to more clearly see the doneness, 
                if you have a hard time judging when brownies are done).</li>
        </ol>
